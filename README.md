# advent-of-code-2021

This is my personal repo of solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) coding problems using javascript.

To test a solution, run `node day{day}/star{star}.js`, where {day} is the day in the advent calendar, and {star} is the star for that day.  
For example, to run the code for day 2 star 1, run `node day2/star1.js`.
